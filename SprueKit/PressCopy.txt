SprueTex is a procedural texture creation tool for the PBR pipeline.

There is so little UI customization that it borders on being nearly uncustomizable. 
Instead everything is centered on an easy to use workflow that is quick to discover and virtually impossible to get lost in.
One solid workflow over hiding unwieldlyness behind unnecessary tweaking.

From color-curves and gradient lookup-tables to baking ambient-occlusion and thickness maps, SprueTex's 108 nodes cover nearly everything.

In lieu of tiresome text-heavy manuals SprueTex's "Quick Guide" help reads more like a pop-up book that
provides the information the user needs where they need it and as they see it. When it's needed the
old fashioned manual is still there, including illustrations of exactly what the different properites of
the many nodes will do.

For heavy use the reporting capabilities make it easy to manage the consistency of assets across many files, enforce art rules, and report to the cheese-on-high. 
The command-line interface is also there for tying into the production pipeline to generate reports or high-res outputs whenever a file is changed or version-control updated. 
The underlying format of the texture-graphs has also been kept as simple as possible with the full intent that the end-user may very well wish to dive into tweaking, scanning, or generating the files for their own purposes.
