# geometry3Sharp

Open-Source (Boost-license) C# library for geometric computing. 

geometry3Sharp only uses C# language features available in .NET 3.5, so it works with the Mono C# runtime used in Unity 5.x (*NOTE: you must configure Unity for this to work, see note at bottom of this file*). 

Currently there is a small amount of unsafe code, however this code is only used in the OBJ reader and a few fast-buffer-copy routines, which can be deleted if you need a safe version (eg for Unity web player).

Some portions of the code are ported from the WildMagic5 C++ library, developed by David Eberly at [Geometric Tools](https://www.geometrictools.com/). WildMagic5 is distributed under the Boost license as well, available [here](https://www.geometrictools.com/Downloads/Downloads.html). Any errors in code marked as ported from WildMagic5 are most certainly ours!

# Core

- **DVector**: indexed list with vector-style interface, but internally stored as separate blocks of memory
    - appending is amortized O(1), never a full buffer copy like normal list
- **RefCountVector**: track index reference counts, maintain list of free indices
- **VectorArray2/VectorArray3**: wrapper around regular array providing N-element access
    - eg operator[] gets/sets Vector3d for VectorArray3d, internally is double[3*count]
- **HBitArray**: hierarchical BitArray, efficient iteration over large-but-sparse bitsets
- **Units**: enums, conversions, string representations
- **gParallel**: multi-threading utilities, including parallel *ForEach* that works w/ .Net 3.5
- **gSerialization**: binary serialization of core types (vectors, frames, polygons, DMesh3)
- **CommandArgumentSet**: string-based argument representation/parsing, useful for command line args, etc
- **DynamicPriorityQueue**: min-heap priority queue for sparse situations (ie subset of large graph). 
- **IndexPriorityQueue**: min-heap priority queue for dense situations (ie small or large number of items in queue)
- **DijkstraGraphDistance**: compute shortest-path distances between nodes in graph, from seed points. Graph is defined externally by iterators and Func's, so this class can easily be applied to many situations.

# Misc

# Unity Interop

geometry3Sharp supports transparent conversion with Unity types.
To enable this, define **G3_USING_UNITY** in your Unity project, by adding this
string to the **Scripting Define Symbols** box in the **Player Settings**.  

Once enabled, code like this will work transparently:

~~~~
Vector3 unityVec;
Vector3f g3Vec;
unityVec = g3vec;
g3vec = unityVec;
~~~~

float->double types will work transparently, while double->float will require an explicit cast:

~~~~
Vector3d g3vecd;
g3vecd = gameObject.transform.position;
gameObject.transform.position = (Vector3)g3vecd;
~~~~

This will work for **Vector2**, **Vector3**, **Quaterion**, **Ray**, **Color**, and **Bounds** (w/ AxisAlignedBox3f)
Note that these conversions will **not** work for equations, so to add a Vector3f and a Vector3, you
will need to explicitly cast one to the other.
